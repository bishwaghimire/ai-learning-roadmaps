# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Roadmap

This roadmap guides learners from **AI fundamentals and classical approaches** to **modern deep learning, large language models, agents, and production-grade AI systems**.  
By the end, you should be able to **design, build, evaluate, and deploy intelligent systems** across real-world domains.

> A **complete Core AI roadmap** — from classical AI to modern GenAI and autonomous systems.
